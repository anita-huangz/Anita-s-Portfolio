# Anita-s-Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Below you'll find links to various data science, machine learning, and software engineering projects I've worked on. Each project showcases my ability to apply technical skills to solve real-world problems.

## Software Engineer Projects 

## Data Science Projects

### 1. [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/anita-huangz/portfolio/tree/master/customer-churn-prediction)
- Predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. This project includes data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

### 2. [Stock Bond Portfolio](https://github.com/anita-huangz/portfolio/tree/master/stock-bond-portfolio)
- Optimizing a stock-bond portfolio across different timeframes by maximizing returns for a given level of risk, considering various market scenarios and investor preferences.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

### 3. [Big-tech Company Case Study](https://github.com/anita-huangz/portfolio/tree/master/doordash-case-study)
- A business case study that analyzes the big-tech's operational inefficiencies, focusing on customer order trends, delivery times, refunds, and merchant performance.
- **Deliverable**: Data analysis and business plan recommendations.

### 4. [Logistics Company Case Study](https://github.com/anita-huangz/portfolio/tree/master/caterpillar-case-study)
- A case study focused on sales performance analysis, market segmentation, and strategic recommendations for the logistics & transportation company.
- **Deliverable**: Analysis presentation with recommendations.

## Computer Systems Projects
### 1. [Project 0: File Cleaner](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject0)
- This project involves cleaning up text files by removing unwanted elements like blank lines, whitespace, and comments.

### 2. [Project 1: Logic Gates](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject1)
- This project contains files related to building basic logic gates and multiplexers.

### 3. [Project 2: Combinational Chips](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject2)
- This project focuses on combinational chips like adders and ALU.

### 4. [Project 3: Sequential_Chips](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject3)
- This project involves chips with memory, including registers and RAM. 

### 5. [Project 4: Hack Assembler](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject4)
- This project involves building an assembler that translates Hack assembly language (.asm) into Hack machine code (.hack). The assembler reads the .asm file, processes it, and outputs a binary file containing the translated instructions.

### 6. [Project 5: Logic Chips](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject5)
- This project involves implementing logic gates and combinational chips using the Hardware Description Language (HDL) as part of the nand2tetris course.

### 7. [Project 6: Hack Assembler](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject6)
- This project implements a Hack Assembler, which converts Hack assembly language commands (.asm files) into Hack machine code (.hack files). The assembler processes assembly code and generates a binary output corresponding to the Hack machine instructions.
