### 2. [Project 1: Logic Gates](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject1)
- Summary: Built a set of elementary logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, MUX) that serve as fundamental building blocks for a computer's architecture.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented using HDL (Hardware Description Language)

### 3. [Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject2)
- Developed arithmetic logic components, including adders and an ALU, to perform arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in HDL, tested using the hardware simulator, and validated using predefined test scripts​

### 4. [Project 3: Memory](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject3)
- Built a RAM unit by constructing memory chips of increasing size and a program counter for controlling execution flow.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in HDL, tested using the hardware simulator, and validated using test scripts​

### 5. [Project 4: Machine Language](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject4)
- Developed and tested programs in Hack assembly language and translated them into binary machine code.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Used the Hack assembler to convert assembly into binary and tested execution using the CPU emulator​

### 6. [Project 5: Computer](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject5)
- Built a simple computer by integrating an ALU, registers, RAM, and a CPU capable of executing machine language instructions.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented using HDL (Hardware Description Language), tested using the hardware simulator, and verified by executing machine language programs

### 7. [Project 6: Assembler](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject6)
- Developed an assembler to translate Hack assembly language into binary Hack machine code.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in a programming language of choice, compared output with a supplied assembler, and validated correctness using a CPU emulator

### 8. [Project 7: VM Translator I](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject7)
- Built a basic VM translator to convert VM commands into Hack assembly language, supporting arithmetic-logical and stack operations.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in a programming language of choice, tested using a CPU emulator, and optionally validated translations with a VM emulator​

### 9. [Project 8: VM Translator II](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject8)
- Extended the VM translator from Project 7 to handle branching and function commands, allowing for the translation of multi-file VM programs.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in a programming language of choice, tested using a CPU emulator, and used the VM emulator to verify translations​

### 10. [Project 9: Jack Programming](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject9)
- Created an interactive program or simple game using the Jack language 
- **Technical Tools Used**: Developed with Jack, compiled using the Jack compiler, and tested using the VM emulator​

### 11. [Project 10: Syntax Analyzer for Jack Programs](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject10)
- Developed a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs and outputs XML reflecting the syntactic structure of the input source code.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in a programming language of choice, used a TextComparer tool for validation, and tested with an XML viewer

### 12. [Project 11: Syntax Analyzer for Jack Programs](computer-systems-notes/HuangAnitaProject11)
- Extended the syntax analyzer from Project 10 into a full-scale Jack compiler by implementing a Symbol Table and Code Generation module to produce executable VM code.
- **Technical Tools Used**: Implemented in a programming language of choice, tested using a VM emulator, and used the existing syntax analyzer from Project 10 as a base​
