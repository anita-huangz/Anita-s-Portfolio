# Project Overview 
The primary objective of this project is to use unsupervised learning techniques to analyze cybersecurity threats globally, uncover hidden patterns, and detect anomalies.

By applying clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, we aim to:

1. **Segment cyber threats** into meaningful clusters to understand attack trends.
2. Identify **high-risk** attacks and industries that are frequently targeted.
3. Detect **anomalies** (rare or extreme incidents) for further investigation.
4. Provide actionable insights for cybersecurity defense strategies. 

# Dataset Description
1. **Country**: Country where the attack occurred
2. **Year**: Year of the incident
3. **Threat Type**: Type of cybersecurity threat (e.g., Malware, DDoS)
4. **Attack Vector**: Method of attack (e.g., Phishing, SQL Injection)
5. **Affected Industry**: Industry targeted (e.g., Finance, Healthcare)
6. **Data Breached (GB)**: Volume of data compromised
7. **Financial Impact ($M)**: Estimated financial loss in millions
8. **Severity Level**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
9. **Response Time (Hours)**: Time taken to mitigate the attack
10. **Mitigation Strategy**: Countermeasures taken
