# Project 2: Combinational Chips

This directory contains the `.hdl` files for all chips required in Project 2, MPCS 52011 2,1 Introduction to Computer Systems, part of www.nand2tetris.org and the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken, MIT Press. 

## Contents 
- 	HalfAdder: Sum and carry 
-	FullAdder: Sum and carry 
-	Add16: Adds two 16-bit numbers, leveraging the “FullAdder”
-	Inc16: Increments a 16-bit number by 1, leveraging the “FullAdder”
- 	ALU: Compute operations based on control bits; include status bits (zero & negative)

## Status 
All chips have been implemented and tested using the provided test scripts. 
All chips work as expected - identical to the compared file.
