"""
You're simulating a portfolio that:
- Starts with $100,000 in cash
- Invests in 5 top tech stocks
- Uses historical data from Jan 1, 2022 to Dec 31, 2024 

run_simulation():
- Downloads price data via yfinance
- Mocks factor data (PE ratio, Market Cap, 12M return, volatility)
- Constructs Security objects to encapsulate that data
- Scores stocks monthly using the factors that you have selected 
- Uses a rank-based optimizer to:
    Select the top 3 stocks
    Allocate capital equally among them
- Rebalances every 21 trading days (~1 month)
- Tracks portfolio value (NAV) over time
